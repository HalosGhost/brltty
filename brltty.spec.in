Summary: Braille display driver for Linux/Unix.
%description
BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides access to
the console screen (when in text mode) for a blind person using a
refreshable braille display.  It drives the braille display, and
provides complete screen review functionality.  Some speech capability
has also been incorporated.

Install this package if you use a refreshable braille display.

%changelog
* Mon Apr 6 2020 Dave Mielke <Dave@Mielke.cc> 6.1
New commands:
   REFRESH: rewrite the whole braille display (some drivers).
   REFRESH_LINE: rewrite a specific braille line (some drivers).
   ROUTE_LINE: bring the cursor to a specific braille line.
New braille drivers:
   Canute: A 40 column, 9 line display from Bristol Braille.
BrlAPI braille driver changes:
   Increase/decrease the client priority based on the screen content quality.
   A quality of "good" overrides Orca rendering - lower ones don't.
HandyTech braille driver changes:
   Basic Braille Plus models are supported.
   The Easy Braille can be autodetected when using Bluetooth.
HumanWare braille driver changes:
   The Brailliant BI 14 can be autodetected when using Bluetooth.
   The routing keys of the Brailliant BI 14 work.
   Four new models are supported:
      HumanWare BrailleOne
      APH Chameleon 20
      APH Mantis Q40
      NLS eReader
Inceptor (BrailleMe) braille driver changes:
   Cursor positioning has been fixed.
   USB (NVDA mode) autodetection works.
   USB (NVDA mode) key bindings have been rationalized.
   Bluetooth (BrailleBack mode) key bindings have been rationalized.
AtSpi2 screen driver changes:
   The BRLTTY and X clipboards are synchronized.
   Highlighted screen regions are supported.
   When a widget doesn't have text then its accessibility name is rendered.
   Set the screen content quality (for the BrlAPI braille driver) as follows:
      good: terminal widgets
      fair: text widgets (e.g. labels)
      poor: widgets that have descriptive text
      none: widgets that don't have a text interface
   The type= parameter now specifies which widgets override Orca rendering.
   type=default has been added (and is the new default).
   The default is to defer to Orca except for terminal widgets.
Linux screen driver changes:
   The fallbackText= parameter has been added.
   Cursor routing when there are wide characters has been fixed.
   Cursor positioning when there are wide characters has been fixed.
BrlAPI changes:
   UTF-8 character encoding is handled internally (no longer needs iconv).
   Large file descriptor numbers no longer cause a client to crash.
   The client and server protocol versions can be increased independently.
   Packets can contain up to 4096 (rather than 512) bytes.
   The brlapi__pause() function can be used to wait for an incoming event.
   A framework for setting, getting, and watching parameters has been added:
      brlapi_getParameterProperties()
      brlapi__getParameter()
      brlapi__getParameterAlloc()
      brlapi__setParameter()
      brlapi__watchParameter()
      brlapi__unwatchParameter()
   The brltty-clip command can be used to get/set the clipboard content.
xbrlapi changes:
   Now backgrounds after successfully establishing the BrlAPI connection.
   The -n (--no-daemon) option disables backgrounding.
   The BRLTTY and X clipboards are synchronized.
Text table changes:
   Defining the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) works properly.
   The fr-vs table supports the middle dot character.
Contraction table changes:
   Undefined characters now fall back to their text table representations.
   The en-ueb-g2 table has been updated.
   The zh-tw-ucb table has been removed.
   Renamed French tables:
      fr-integral -> fr-g1
      fr-abrege -> fr-g2
   Renamed German tables:
      de-basis -> de-g0
      de-vollschrift -> de-g1
      de-kurzschrift -> de-g2
      de-kurzschrift-1998 -> de-1998
      de-kurzschrift-2015 -> de-2015
Linux changes:
   The systemd and udev wrappers are now in /usr/lib/brltty/.
Android changes:
   The Update Application button on the Actions screen works.
   Routing key #7 presents the Accessibility Actions for a screen element.
Windows changes:
   A potential BrlAPI client/server communication deadlock has been fixed.
   Some .bat scripts have been renamed:
      install-brltty -> enable-brlapi
      uninstall-brltty -> disable-brlapi
      run-debug -> debug-brltty
